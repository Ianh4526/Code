#from import Statements

#An alternative form of the import statement is composed of the from keyword,
#followed by the module name, the import keyword, and a star; for example, from random import *.

#Ending a Program Early with sys.exit()

#The last flow control concept to cover is how to terminate the program.

#You can import Modules and get access to nwe functions.
#The modules that come with python are called the standard library, but you can also install third-party modules using the pip tool
#the sys.exit() function will immediately quit your Program.
#the pyperclip third-party module has copy() and paste() functions for reading and writing to the clipboard

Lesson 4 - Recording

User Interface Recording

The recorder works like other macro recording apps like AutoHotKey and Automator but on steroids

Allowing to record and replay actions, and by allowing you to modify and parametrize the recorded sequence.
it's good because it gives you a workflow that you can use as a framework to build upon.


Types of recording
Basic
Desktop:     the actions performed are nested inside an AttachWindow Container app, menus, pop-ups, dialogs windows so other windows of the same application don't interfere with your workflow
Web
Citrix

Basic and Desktop are similar and are used to record most desktop applications that you may work with.

web recording is similar to the first two but made for browsers and web apps

Citrix is for virtual machines, VNC and CItrix enviromens

Recordable 
LEFT clicks on
Buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc

Text Typing

Non-Recordable//// Manual Recording
keyboard shortcuts
modifiers keys
Right click
Mouse Hover
Etc
Getting Text
Find elements and images
Copy to clipboard

UiPath identifies the right window by using
Name of the app
Title of the window
Current open file
and other details


BASIC RECORDING
pros
Actions are self-contained
simpler workflow
cons
can cause interference

DESKTOP RECORDING
pros
Actions are contained inside an AttachWindow component
No interference issues
cons
More complex workflow

F2 to pause the recording

Manual Recording 
is the process of telling Uipath to do all those actions that cannot be recorded 

Selectors 
Is like a recipe for finding the correct element on the screen, or like a file path on windows, except a bit more complex.

WEB RECORDING
like desktop recording but for web...

to make uipath think a generic is a number starts with a number
and if its a string start with a string

make a copy of the current workflow is a good practice

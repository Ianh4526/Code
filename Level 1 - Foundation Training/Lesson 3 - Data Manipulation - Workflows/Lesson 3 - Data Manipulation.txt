Lesson 3 - Data Manipulation


Data
Text, numbers, datetimes
arrays, list
Tables

Are stored in variables and use VB expressions to configure activities
ctrl + k to create variables


Categories of Variables
Scalar Variables: holding a single value of fixed type
Characters, booleans Numbers Date times

Collections 
Arrays, list , queue
String
Dictionaries 2 synchronized collectios of associated names and values that allow a value to be referenced b y its name rather than its index. Pull data from Orchestrator queues


Tables
2 dimensional structures thath hold data index by rows and columns. similar to an array of dictionaries, wherer values are accessible by row index and column names


Generic Value
Special type, entire unique on UiPath that simplifies the use of basic activities. it can represent basic types of data
String, Boolean, DateTimes

pros: 
Flexible use of variables
No considerations of the type

Cons
No handling methods 
imprecise expressions evaluations

Collections
Arrays fixed sized
handy in most placed

List
Flexible size
Advanced use cases

defining array
pick data type and specify elements type
optional give a  default value like a comma-separated sequence items {asd,asd,asd

defining a list
browse the generic.list type and then pick the content type
to initialize set the default value to a new list, stating again the element type in the declaration
Optional 
providing some content to the new list using an initialization array
new List of String from{asda,asdasd

uses a for each activity and selecting the correct type argument

to add to a list 
using invoke method
target list object
methodName Add
and the new element specified in the parameters property element type should match


Dictionaries
used for working with the orchestrator queues and also hold multiple values in a single variable
reducing argument when passing data between workflows

to define browse for the dictionarie and especifiy the  type key type and value type
to initialize wiht values use the dictionary constructor with an array of  key/value pairs

addding with a simple assign 
the key name specified to the left and the new value to the right


Text, String 

Input: email, files,screen screping
Output: applications, emails, files,logs
Internal(no input or output):  Selectors, names, files paths

set a string in the variable pane

string is a sequence of characters encosed in double quotes if it have quotes write them twice(scape sequence) 
ready to be used in expressions
using methosds just use dot at the end of the variable name

Handling Text

Extracting data
Split method

Assembling Text
Concatenation
string.format Method

Concatenation using the + but if are various types need to individual converted to string al types have a default .tostring

much data uses a strign format automaticaly converts data to text representation and it also suports custom formatting

Method
Contains
Endswith/startwith
format
replace
split
substring
Tolower/toupper
Trim



Data Tables
from Excels, CSV files
Web data screpping

Lesson 2- variables & Data Types


Three main areas 

Activities panel: an action that we will use to automate different applications data processing actions

workflow designer: build automation project by dragging or generated by the recorder

Properties pane: see and change the different parameters  and the settings of the selected activity

FLOWCHARTS AND SEQUENCES

To control which action takes place and when 

flowchart works by executing each action starting with the start node and following the arrows,
there are decision nodes that can change the course of the executions. higher levels of automation

Sequence: a simple list of actions that we tell UiPath to take one after the other. for shorter simpler workflows
 there can be any kind of sequences and flowcharts one inside the others

VARIABLES

something that can have different values

boxes that keep different types of data the data in the box can change but the box remains the same

Main types of variables

Integer  whole numbers
String     Text of any kind
Boolean     True False
Generic      All the above
An array of      A list of any type

if you rename variable in the variable tab it changes the name in every place is used

and the scope is the place where the variable is located

Assign transfer the value on the right to the variable on the left
